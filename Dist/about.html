                <p>
                <p> My name is Oshin Tiwari, and I’m an AI Engineer passionate about leveraging machine learning and data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems. My journey in technology started in Indore, India, and brought me to Fort Collins, Colorado, where I completed my graduate studies in Computer Engineering at Colorado State University.
                    During my time at CSU, I conducted advanced research under the guidance of <a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/ece/people/jesse-wilson/">Dr.
                        Jesse Wilson</a>, focusing on image translation using conditional GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)

                <p>
                    I love solving complex problems through AI and data-driven approaches, whether it’s fine-tuning machine learning models or designing scalable pipelines. My professional experience includes deploying zero-shot classification models, optimizing workflows with multi-agent systems, and creating tools for regulatory compliance and product classification. 

                </p>
                <p> 
                    Outside of work, I’m a huge animal lover, especially dogs, and I enjoy spending time outdoors, engaging in team activities, and discovering new music. As a proud Taylor Swift fan, her lyrics inspire my creativity and drive. Whether it’s collaborating on projects or exploring new ideas, I thrive in dynamic, team-oriented environments where innovation meets camaraderie.
